# Desktop-Library-Application
A user-friendly desktop application was developed for a real library, allowing users to search for books using the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) and to borrow them virtually. To enhance efficiency, the Agile methodology was used for the development of the application. The application improved the administration of members, book transactions, cataloguing, and record-keeping, resulting in increased efficiency for both library staff and members. The interface was designed to be user-friendly, enabling library personnel to efficiently manage and monitor member information, book transactions, and cataloguing. A database system was developed to minimize mistakes and facilitate instantaneous modifications to library entries. Additionally, a search feature was created to allow users to efficiently locate books by various parameters such as author, title, and genre. A reporting functionality was also developed to produce instantaneous analytics and reports using the data gathered by the system. Measures were implemented to ensure the system's reliability and security, thereby reducing the risk of data loss or unauthorized access.
